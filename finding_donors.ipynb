    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "Logistic Regression\n",
    "- In medical industry: To predict if a person is COVID positive or negative\n",
    "- Strengths: Simplest binary classifier, doesnt require high computation power, works well (less prone to overfitting) for low dimensional dataset (no.of features << total no.of observations), workes well on linearly separable features, gives inference on feature importance\n",
    "- Weakness: Performs poorly on high dimensional dataset (prones to overfitting), performs poorly on non-linearly features, performs poorly if features are highly dependent on each other, cant be used for complex problems\n",
    "- It is a good candidate since the problem is a simplest binary classification, it has a low dimensional dataset (#features = 13, #total_samples = ~45K), features are more or less independent of each other after scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest\n",
    "- E-commerce industries: Product Recommendation by predicting the customer's preferences based on past purchases\n",
    "- Strengths: can be used for both classification & regression problems, doesnt overfit since it uses ransom subset of the dataset, provides a better trade-off between high variance-bias, accurate on non-linear dataset, not affected by missing values or outliers\n",
    "- Weakness: Slow or time consuming since needs to make prediction from each of the multiple decision tree its using, not easily interpretable \n",
    "- Small dataset, will provide feature importance to select the most contributing features of the model easily, will give highly accurate results, forms new nodes during every split based on these features that will help in better prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost \n",
    "- Facial Detection: Adaboost algorithms can be used as a complex boundary detection algo & used to create new features , classify if the image has a face or not if the boundary is found. \n",
    "- Strengths: Can be used both as classification or regression problem, It focuses on reducing the classification error by shifting the weights of the features to incorrectly classified learners upon every iteration, curbs overfitting, high accuracy on testing dataset, easy to tune the hyper parameters since it has quite less hyperparameters to deal with \n",
    "- Weaknesses: Needs quality data, sensitive to outliers as this method is too dependent on them as its is obliged to fix the errors from its previous predictors, might require more extensive data pre-processing if the dataset is more noisy\n",
    "- CharityML is a relatively small dataset, low dimensionality, less noisy. As accuracy in predicting which person makes >=50K is more important, using an ensemble method such as adaboost which gives high accurate results seems apt. \n"

    "The chosen model iteratively reduces errors produced due to incorrect classification & finally aggregates all the results to compute a final boundary that will help in classifying the results accurately. It will not lead to any memorization of data & will generalize better due to its efforts to reducing misclassification errors. It creates decision stumps (learners), starts by making predictions on the original dataset in easy language, and then it gives equal weights to each observation. If the prediction made using the first learner is incorrect, it allocates the higher importance to the incorrectly predicted statement  so that they are assigned correctly in the next decision stump, hence being an iterative process. It goes on to add new learners (decision stumps) until the limit is reached in the model. \n",

    "Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
    "- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.\n",

    "**Note:** Depending on the algorithm chosen and the parameter list, the following implementation may take some time to run!"

    "- Top 5 features given by the model doesnt match to perception of top 5 features in Question 6.\n",
    "- These features seem to be more relevant & chosen by the model based on the relationship between the target income label & each of these features from the dataset provided to us. From the graph, the important features are chosen based on the higher weights or coefficient a certain feature has which could be calculated based on how each individual feature is independently related to the target variable &/or how a combination of these 5 features are related to the target variable. My answers did not match, probably due to the fact that they are biased due to common societal interpretations of that a highly educated person with a higher degree is more qualified & likely to get a higher income. However, machine learning models take the mathematical relation ship between the features & the target variable, thereby produce the important features. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "- Different supervised models give different results of important features. For example, the top 5 features respectively(arranged from highest to lowest) are:\n",
    "  - Random Forest Classifer: Age, hours-per-week, capital-gain, education-num, marital-status, married-civ-spouse\n",
    "  - AdaBoost Classifier: capital-loss, age, capital-gain, hours-per-week, education-num\n",
    "Due to different feature selection vy different supervised models, the best classifier model chosen by grid search on the whole training dataset gives different results.\n",
    "  - Feature Importance using Randomforest classifier, shows the final model trained on reduced data has accuracy of ~85% & f-score of ~71% (Dropped by ~1.5% in accuracy & ~2% in f-score approx)\n",

    "- If training time is a factor, then a trade-off should be set between the model eval metrics (accuracy or f-score) & model computation time. \n",
    "a) If the reduced feature dataset gives a slightly lower testing accuracy or f-score (or any other desired eval metric)  with a faster computation time, I will select a less complex model with fewer attributes. \n",
    "b) If the reduced feature dataset drops to a significantly lower eval metrics/lower performance, then I will go ahead with training the full dataset at the cost of high computation time\n",
    "c) If the reduced feature dataset shows improvement in performance of the model with good improvement in computation time, will ofcourse, go ahead with reduced feature dataset. \n",
